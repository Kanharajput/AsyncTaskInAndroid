# AsyncTaskInAndroid
if we want to access some data from the internet or may need to calculate something which required time then 
we must use AsyncTask as it will do this operation on worker thread and reply to the ui thread when the work is done.
So it will not affect the main thread and due to that all ui elements are working fine while the process is happening in the background.
